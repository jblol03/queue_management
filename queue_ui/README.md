Below is a detailed README.md for a Flutter-based project (`queue_ui`) that interacts with a Django-based backend (`queue_management`). This README includes setup instructions and details on how to connect the Flutter app to the Django API.

### queue_ui (Flutter Frontend)

#### Project Overview:

`queue_ui` is a Flutter-based frontend for a queue management system. It communicates with the Django-based backend (`queue_management`) for data retrieval and updates.

#### Prerequisites:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)

#### Getting Started:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/queue_ui.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd queue_ui
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4. **Configure API Endpoint:**

   Open the `lib/constants.dart` file and update the `BASE_API_URL` variable with the URL of your Django API.

    ```dart
    // lib/constants.dart

    const String BASE_API_URL = 'http://your-django-api-url/';
    ```

5. **Run the App:**

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

   The Flutter app will start on an emulator or connected device.

#### Connecting to Django API:

The Flutter app communicates with the Django API for data retrieval and updates. Ensure that the Django API is running and accessible.

1. **API URL Configuration:**

   Update the `BASE_API_URL` in `lib/constants.dart` with the correct URL of your Django API.

    ```dart
    // lib/constants.dart

    const String BASE_API_URL = 'http://your-django-api-url/';
    ```

2. **API Endpoints:**

   The app assumes specific API endpoints for managing the queue. Make sure your Django API exposes the necessary endpoints.

   Example API endpoints:

   - Get all queues: `GET http://your-django-api-url/api/queues/`
   - Create a new queue: `POST http://your-django-api-url/api/queues/`
   - Update a queue: `PUT http://your-django-api-url/api/queues/<queue_id>/`
   - Delete a queue: `DELETE http://your-django-api-url/api/queues/<queue_id>/`

#### Additional Commands:

- **Build Release APK:**

    ```bash
    flutter build apk --release
    ```

- **Run Tests:**

    ```bash
    flutter test
    ```

### Notes:

- Customize the clone URL based on your repository location.
- Update the `BASE_API_URL` with the correct URL of your Django API.
- The app assumes specific API endpoints. Ensure your Django API follows a similar structure.
- Adjust the API connection details based on your Django API's authentication and authorization requirements.

This README provides detailed instructions for setting up the Flutter app and connecting it to a Django API. Customize it further based on the specific features and requirements of your projects.
