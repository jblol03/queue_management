Mobile App Queue Management System Architecture

Components:

Mobile App User Interface (UI):

Customer UI: Allows customers to view services, join queues, and monitor their status.
Agent UI: Enables agents to manage their queues, view customer information, and update request statuses.
Queue Manager (Backend System):

Handles logic for queue ordering, customer-agent matching, and real-time status updates.
Notification Service:

Sends push notifications to customers and agents for queue updates and alerts.
Data Storage:

Stores customer and agent profiles, queue data, and historical interaction logs.
Reporting and Analytics Engine:

Analyzes data to produce insights on queue metrics and agent performance.
Workflow:

Customer Queue Interaction:

The customer opens the mobile app.
They select the desired service and join the appropriate queue.
The Queue Manager assigns a queue number and estimated wait time.
The customer receives a push notification confirming their queue status.
Real-Time Queue Monitoring:

The customer can view their real-time position in the queue via the app.
Notifications alert the customer as they move up in the queue.
Agent Queue Management:

Agents log into their mobile app UI.
They view and accept incoming customer requests from the queue.
Agents can see customer details and any specific requests or notes.
Service Interaction:

The agent interacts with the customer, which can include in-app messaging or a call.
The agent updates the request status as needed (e.g., In Progress, On Hold, Completed).
Completion and Feedback:

Once the service is complete, the agent marks the request as resolved.
The customer receives a notification and can leave feedback through the app.
Data Analysis and Reporting:

The backend system collects data from each interaction.
The Reporting and Analytics Engine processes this data to create performance reports.
Management accesses these reports via a secured section within the app or a web interface to make informed decisions.
